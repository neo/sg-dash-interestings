* Did you ever `git push --tags` only to have your CI thrown up its hands in despair as it tries to build your tag? That's because `--tags` doesn't push the commits the tags refer to. Use `--follow-tags` to push both. You can also [configure git to do this by default](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3745250).
