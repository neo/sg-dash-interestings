### Interestings for Monday, December 14, 2015

* [Stockfighter](https://www.stockfighter.io/) is a new programming game in a capture the flag style. There is a hardware and a software track and it looks like a lot of fun. Brought to you by some of the team behind Square's CTF from a few years ago (which Gabe liked)
* [OlliOlli 2](http://www.roll7.co.uk/#!olliolli2/ccko) is a fun side-scrolling skateboarding tricks game out on multiple platforms, including the PSP.
