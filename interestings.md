## Standup notes for Wed, 10 Feb 2016

### Interestings

- [Rack](http://rack.github.io/) was inspired by [WSGI](http://wsgi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) says James

- [WSGI 2.0 discussions](http://wsgi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/proposals-2.0.html) are interesting because they have to keep all the current users happy while integrating things like websockets and HTTP2.

- [Face recognition and Right Whales - NOAA/Kaggle competition](http://deepsense.io/deep-learning-right-whale-recognition-kaggle)

- [Amazon announces Lumberjack, a free Game Engine](http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2016/02/09/out-of-nowhere-amazon-debuts-its-own-free-game-engine-lumberjack/)

- The [Heliospheric Current sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliospheric_current_sheet) describes why the solar wind looks like it does.
